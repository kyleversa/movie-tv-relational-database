# Movie & TV Relational Database (Oracle SQL)

This project was developed as part of CCPS 510 (Database Systems) and models a structured relational database for managing movies, TV shows, actors, directors, genres, users, and reviews.

The goal of the project was to design a normalized relational schema, enforce data integrity through constraints, and demonstrate meaningful query analysis across related entities.

---

## Project Overview

The database includes:

- Entity modeling and normalization
- Primary and foreign key relationships
- Business rule enforcement through constraints
- Sample dataset population
- Analytical SELECT queries across multiple joins

This project demonstrates structured schema design, relational modeling, and SQL query development.
